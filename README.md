### What are implemented in this project?
- API(by Yelp API)

- Set favored items (named VisitHistory)
- Recommend new items (named RecommendItems)

### What is Yelp API?
It is an open API for public users to access information from Yelp such that we can fetch real restaurant information including name, description, location, category, etc. It plays a role as the following:

### How does database work?
When the number of user is large, we need DSMS to manage data. We can fullfill functions like store all of informations related to each user, retrieve data based on conditions quackly, update, add or delete data timely, access data with authorization. We involve four tables in our case:

+ users - store user information.
+ items - store item information.
+ history - store user favorite/purchase history (many-to-many).
+ category - store item-category relationship (many-to-many).

E.g. we want to get the table of history 

`http://localhost:8080/Titan/history?user_id=1111`

### How does recommendation system workï¼Ÿ
- User-based method(similarity of users) 
- Item-base method(similarity of items)
- Content-based recommendation(similarity of characterastics)

When the recommendation system does not contain enough users/data, we use contend-based method firstly, combined with user/ item-based recommendation method. In this case, We recommend restaurants with similar categories as those in history table and rank items based on distance.
